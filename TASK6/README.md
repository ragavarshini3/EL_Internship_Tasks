README.md ‚Äî Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis
üìå Overview

This project is part of my Elevate Labs Internship ‚Äì Data Analytics Track.
Task 6 focuses on analyzing sales data from an e-commerce dataset stored in PostgreSQL, and generating monthly revenue trends, top months by revenue, and year-specific breakdowns.

üóÇ Dataset

File: online_sales.csv
Rows: 49,782
Columns:

InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country, Discount, PaymentMethod, ShippingCost, Category, SalesChannel, ReturnStatus, ShipmentProvider, WarehouseLocation, OrderPriority

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

Created PostgreSQL Table matching CSV columns.

Imported Data into PostgreSQL using \copy.

Cleaned Data by ensuring correct data types & handling nulls.

Analyzed Trends using SQL aggregation functions.

Exported Results as CSV for reporting.

üìä Queries
1Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Revenue & Order Count
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', invoicedate)::DATE AS month,
    SUM(COALESCE(quantity,0) * COALESCE(unitprice,0)
        - COALESCE(discount,0)
        + COALESCE(shippingcost,0)) AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT invoiceno) AS order_count
FROM online_sales.orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 Months by Revenue
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', invoicedate)::DATE AS month,
    SUM(COALESCE(quantity,0) * COALESCE(unitprice,0)
        - COALESCE(discount,0)
        + COALESCE(shippingcost,0)) AS monthly_revenue
FROM online_sales.orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;

3Ô∏è‚É£ Year-Specific Breakdown (Example: 2024)
SELECT
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM invoicedate)::INT AS month,
    SUM(COALESCE(quantity,0) * COALESCE(unitprice,0)
        - COALESCE(discount,0)
        + COALESCE(shippingcost,0)) AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT invoiceno) AS order_count
FROM online_sales.orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM invoicedate) = 2024
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

üìå Key Insights

Sales peaks occur in specific months, indicating seasonal trends.

Higher revenue often correlates with higher average order values.

Year-wise filtering helps identify growth patterns.
