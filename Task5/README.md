# ðŸš¢ Task 5 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This task involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and factors influencing passenger survival.  
The analysis includes:
- Data overview and cleaning
- Missing value treatment
- Feature engineering
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Correlation and multicollinearity checks
- Outlier and skewness handling
- Visualization of key insights
